# 🙏 Bible Emotion App

Ever felt sad, anxious, or just overwhelmed — and wanted the right Bible verse to speak to that moment?

This app helps you do exactly that.

Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**, the Bible Emotion App lets you select your current emotion and instantly receive an uplifting Bible verse tailored to that feeling.

## ✨ Why I Built This

I created this as a personal coding challenge — but also as a meaningful tool for people who find comfort in Scripture.

Instead of random verse generators, I wanted to build something **emotionally intelligent** — where you could say:  
> "I'm feeling ___" — and immediately be reminded of God’s Word for that exact emotion.
